# Iris Exploration and Machine Learning 
This project is a part of my exploration as a data science student. Other projects can be found on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/erik-bach).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to practice working with and exploring datasets in Python and Jupyter Notebook. I will be documenting my thoughts as work through the dataset and try to implement new technologies to my skillset. I will also be using this as a starting point for different data science projects in the future.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Seaborn
* scikit-learn
* numpy

## Project Description
This project utilizes the [iris dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris?datasetId=19&sortBy=voteCount), which is where most people start with their data science explorations. This project marks the start of my journey in developing my skills in data science. Right now, the scope of this project is to set a starting benchmark for my skills and to try to dive into machine learning with scikit-learn. I'm seeking to learn to ask questions about a dataset that aren't the most obvious, and to be able to extend my learning from my coursework. This might be an extremely simple dataset, but I know that there's a lot of information I can derive from the data and there's a long way before I am able to do so.
